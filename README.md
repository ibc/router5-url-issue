# router5-url-issue

Web app that shows the problem reported in https://github.com/router5/router5/issues/248

**NOTE:** The problem happens when there is a `children` route. I've not been able to reproduce it without `children`.

The JS code is very simple (just check the [router5-url-issue.js](router5-url-issue.js) file.

## Usage

Install deps:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Run the built-in web server (will open a browser tab) running the app:

```bash
$ gulp live
```
